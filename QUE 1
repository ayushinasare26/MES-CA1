QUE 1: Execute an 8051-assembly language program for a safety-certified system in which the instructions CJNE, DJNZ, and SUBB are not permitted. Two unsigned numbers are stored
in internal RAM locations 50H and 51H. The program must compare these two numbers using only the allowed instruction set (MOV, INC, DEC, JZ, JNZ, CLR, SETB, ANL, ORL) and
store the comparison result in a register or memory location such that 01H indicates the value at 50H is greater than the value at 51H, 00H indicates both values are
equal, and FFH indicates the value at 50H is less than the value at 51H. The program should be simulated for all three possible cases (A > B, A = B, A < B), and the solution must
clearly explain how flag behavior (especially the Zero flag) is utilized to achieve comparison under the given instruction constraints.

MOV A, #08H
ADD A, #03H

MOV B, #64H
MUL AB

ADD A, #4AH
